    "description": "This project examines the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock market prices using two data pipelines. The first pipeline uses LocalStack to mimic Amazon S3 for data storage and messaging, while the second utilises Apache Kafka for real-time streaming and message exchange. Both pipelines process financial news and stock price data, calculate sentiment scores, merge this data, and then index it into Elasticsearch for analysis and visualisation.",
